This project was created as part of FreeCodeCamp's front-end libraries certification.

It is the front-end libraries project: Build a Random Quote Machine

https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-random-quote-machine

It's an app that displays random quotes that you can tweet or get a new random quote. The quotes are not fetched from anywhere, and are just currently taken from a constant javascript array of objects.


Created using React, and create-react-app, deployed with gh-pages.

You can run it locally with `npm start`

Or you can visit the website in the description above to view the gh-pages version.
